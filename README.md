UNIX BUILD

Building under most UNIX systems is easy, just run the configure script and 
then run make. For more information about the build process, see the 
tcl/unix/README file in the Tcl src dist. The following minimal example will 
install the extension in the /opt/tcl directory.

    $ cd thiredis
    $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/tcl
    $ make
    $ make install

If you need setup directory containing tcl configuration (tclConfig.sh), 
below is an example:

    $ cd thiredis
    $ ./configure --with-tcl=/opt/activetcl/lib
    $ make
    $ make install
